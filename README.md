# 2D Game Engine Project

## Description

This project is a custom **2D Game Engine** designed to create games with a focus on pixel art, similar to classic titles like *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* for the SNES. The game engine is built to be flexible, allowing for the creation of various 2D games. It incorporates features such as input handling, sprite rendering, and support for multiple types of games.

### Key Features:
- **Pixel Art Rendering**: Optimized for retro-style, pixel-based graphics.
- **Input Handling**: Built-in support for game controllers and keyboard inputs.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed to be reusable for multiple games.
- **SDL2 Integration**: Uses SDL2 for window management, rendering, and input.

## Tech Demos (Not Implemented yet but are planned)

1. **Zelda-Inspired Demo**: A tech demo showcasing movement, collision detection, and animations based on a top-down perspective.
2. **Sonic-Inspired Demo**: A second demo will highlight the engine's ability to handle platformer physics and side-scrolling environments.

## Usage

Once the game engine is up and running, you can:

- **Move the player character** using the keyboard or controller inputs.
- **Navigate different game worlds** designed with the pixel art style.
- **Test the game physics** (platformer and top-down) depending on the demo you're running.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the player character.
- **Spacebar**: Action button (interact, jump, etc.).
- **Esc**: Quit the game.

## Features in Development

- **Customizable Sprite System**: Support for importing and managing sprite sheets.
- **Game Physics Engine**: Incorporating collision detection and object physics for platformers and top-down games.
- **Audio Integration**: Adding support for sound effects and background music.
- **UI and HUD Components**: A user interface system for menus, health bars, and in-game HUDs.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains all the source code for the game engine.
  - `main.cpp`: Entry point for the engine.
  - `input.cpp`: Handles input management (keyboard, controllers).
  - `render.cpp`: Responsible for rendering sprites and environments.
  
- **assets/**: Folder for game assets such as sprites, textures, and audio files.

## Dependencies

- **SDL2**: Simple DirectMedia Layer for handling rendering, input, and window management.
- **C++**: The primary programming language used for this engine.

## Future Enhancements

- **Level Editor**: A visual tool to allow easy creation of maps and game worlds.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Adding support for local and online multiplayer modes.
- **AI System**: Simple AI behavior for NPCs and enemies.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Expanding compatibility to more platforms such as mobile devices and consoles.
